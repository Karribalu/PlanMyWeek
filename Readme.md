### Technology Stack

**Frontend** (`/frontend`)

- **React 19** with TypeScript and Vite for fast development
- **Material-UI** for consistent, accessible component library
- **React Router** for client-side navigation
- **Direct GraphQL queries** with manual fetch (no Apollo Client complexity)

**Backend** (`/backend`)

- **Apollo Server** with TypeScript ESM modules
- **Schema-first GraphQL** with modular `.graphql` files
- **Open-Meteo Integration** for comprehensive weather data
- **Mock Location Service** for development (easily replaceable)

**Key Design Decisions**

1. **Schema-First GraphQL**: Enables contract-driven development and better tooling
2. **Monorepo Structure**: Clear separation of concerns while maintaining related code proximity
3. **Weather API Choice**: Open-Meteo provides rich data without API key complexity
4. **TypeScript Throughout**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience
5. **Component-Based UI**: Reusable components with clear prop interfaces

## 🧠 Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

### Architectural Choices

**✅ GraphQL over REST**

- **Benefit**: Type safety, single endpoint, efficient data fetching
- **Trade-off**: Additional complexity vs simple REST endpoints
- **Decision**: GraphQL's benefits outweigh complexity for this use case

**✅ Schema-First Approach**

- **Benefit**: Contract-driven development, better tooling, clear API contracts
- **Trade-off**: Requires build step to copy schema files
- **Decision**: Developer experience and API clarity justify the build complexity

**✅ Material-UI Component Library**

- **Benefit**: Consistent design system, accessibility, rapid development
- **Trade-off**: Bundle size and learning curve
- **Decision**: Time constraints favor proven component library over custom CSS

**✅ Mock Location Data**

- **Benefit**: No external API dependencies, fast development iteration
- **Trade-off**: Limited to predefined locations
- **Decision**: Focus on core ranking algorithm rather than geocoding integration

### Code Quality Decisions

**TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enabled across both frontend and backend for maximum type safety
**ESM Modules**: Modern JavaScript modules for better tree shaking and Node.js compatibility  
**Separation of Concerns**: Clear service layer separation for business logic
**Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and GraphQL error responses

**📊 Data Persistence**

- **Why**: In-memory data sufficient for demo; adds deployment complexity
- **Production Fix**: Add PostgreSQL/MongoDB for user data and caching

**🌍 Real Geocoding Service**

- **Why**: Mock data eliminates API dependencies and rate limits during development
- **Production Fix**: Integrate Google Maps/Mapbox geocoding with proper API key management

**🧪 Comprehensive Testing**

- **Why**: Time constraints prioritized core functionality over test coverage
- **Production Fix**: Add Jest/React Testing Library tests for components and GraphQL resolvers

**🚀 Production Deployment Configuration**

- **Why**: Development setup sufficient for technical assessment
- **Production Fix**: Add Docker containers, environment config, CI/CD pipeline

**⚡ Performance Optimizations**

- **Why**: Current performance adequate for demo scale
- **Production Fixes**:
  - Redis caching for weather API responses
  - GraphQL query complexity limiting
  - Database indexing for location searches
  - CDN for static assets

### Shortcuts Taken

**Location Search Algorithm**: Simple string matching vs fuzzy search
**Weather Data Caching**: No caching implemented (API calls on every request)
**Error Boundaries**: Basic error handling vs comprehensive user error feedback
**Loading States**: Minimal loading indicators vs rich skeleton screens

### How I Would Address These in Production

1. **Scalability**: Implement proper caching layers, database optimization, and API rate limiting
2. **Reliability**: Add comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and fallback mechanisms
3. **Security**: Input validation, API authentication, and proper environment variable management
4. **Monitoring**: Application metrics, error tracking, and performance monitoring
5. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E testing with CI/CD pipeline
